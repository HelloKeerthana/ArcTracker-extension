## Arc & Mood Mapping

Each mood score (0â€“10) is mapped to a specific "arc" that reflects overall productivity for the day:

| Score | Arc Name               | Description                                           |
|-------|------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|
| 10    | Villain Arc            | Highly productive with zero distraction.             |
| 9     | Winter Arc             | Near-peak performance, strong discipline.            |
