ArcTracker
ArcTracker is a chrome extension made for those of us living in constant main character energy
inspired by ayanokoji from classroom of the elite, the guy who’s always ten steps ahead without flexing it, i built this to track whether i’m actually cooking or just getting cooked

everyone’s been talking about arcs lately -> villain arc, redemption arc, gym arc... so i thought, why not track your browser arc

this extension logs how much time you spend on each site, sorts it into productive or entertainment, and gives you a mood score and arc label. it also visualizes everything with clean graphs and lets you tag sites however you want. use it to hold yourself accountable or just flex your winter arc at the end of the day
